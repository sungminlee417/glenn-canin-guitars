# Ordering a Custom Guitar

## The Process

Commissioning a custom classical guitar is an exciting journey. From the initial consultation through delivery, you'll be involved in creating an instrument that perfectly matches your musical needs and aesthetic preferences.

## Timeline

A custom guitar typically requires 3-4 months to complete, though this can vary depending on current order backlog and complexity of the build. We'll provide a more accurate timeline during your consultation.

## Pricing

Custom guitars start at $8,000, with final pricing depending on:
- Wood selection

- Decorative elements (rosette, bindings, inlays)
- Case options

## Deposit and Payment

- 50% deposit required to begin construction
- Balance due upon completion
- Payment plans available for qualifying customers

## Warranty

All guitars come with a limited lifetime warranty to the original owner, covering defects in materials and workmanship. Normal wear, damage from neglect or accident, and modifications by others are not covered.
