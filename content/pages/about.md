Building a classical guitar is both an art and a science. It requires deep understanding of acoustics, materials, and the needs of professional musicians. Every guitar that leaves the workshop has been carefully voiced and adjusted to ensure optimal playability and tone.

## Materials

Only the finest tonewoods are selected for each instrument:
- Premium European spruce and cedar for soundboards
- Exotic rosewoods, cypress, and maple for backs and sides
- Ebony fingerboards and bridges
- Traditional French polish finish

## Custom Orders

Each guitar can be customized to meet the specific needs and preferences of the player. From scale length and neck profile to wood selection and aesthetic details, every aspect can be tailored to create your perfect instrument.
