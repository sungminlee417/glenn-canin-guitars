journeyTitle: "My Journey"
journeyContent: |
  I've always enjoyed working with my hands, building everything from go-carts to custom skateboards. While studying classical guitar at San Diego State University under Pepe, Celin, and Celedonio Romero, I supported myself by shaping custom surfboards.
  
  My journey into guitar making began when a friend returned from Spain with mediocre instruments. I decided I could build something better, starting with a flamenco guitar that impressed guitarist Jason McGuire. Though I began with flamenco guitars, I soon transitioned to classical guitars, my true passion in life. After teaching the Alexander Technique for several years, I've devoted myself fully to crafting exceptional classical guitars.
philosophyTitle: "Philosophy"
philosophyContent: |
  I believe that a great guitar is more than just wood and strings â€“ it's a partner in musical expression. Every instrument I build is designed to inspire, to respond to the subtlest touch, and to project with clarity and power.
  
  My approach combines traditional Spanish guitar-making techniques with modern innovations like the doubletop construction, which provides exceptional volume and sustain while maintaining the warmth and complexity of tone that classical guitarists cherish.
