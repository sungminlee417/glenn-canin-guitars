# Get in Touch

Whether you're interested in commissioning a custom guitar, scheduling a workshop visit, or have questions about our instruments, we'd love to hear from you.

## Workshop Visits

We welcome visitors to our workshop by appointment. This is a wonderful opportunity to see guitars in various stages of construction, discuss custom options, and try completed instruments.

## Commissioning a Guitar

The process of commissioning a custom guitar begins with a conversation about your needs and preferences. We'll discuss wood choices, specifications, and timeline to create an instrument perfectly suited to you.

## Repairs and Restoration

In addition to building new instruments, we offer repair and restoration services for classical guitars. Please contact us to discuss your instrument's needs.
