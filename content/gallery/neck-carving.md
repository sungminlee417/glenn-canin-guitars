Each neck is hand-carved to perfectly fit the player's hand and playing style. Glenn works closely with each client to determine the ideal neck profile, from the traditional Spanish 'C' shape to more modern ergonomic contours. The process requires years of experience to achieve the perfect balance of comfort and structural integrity.
