This exceptional double top guitar features Western Red Cedar paired with East Indian Rosewood. The instrument was completed in January 2024 and represents the culmination of years of refinement in double top construction techniques. The cedar top provides warmth and immediate response, while the rosewood back and sides add depth and complexity to the tone.
